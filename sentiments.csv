17,now hard to find bar as refurbished models the iphone se isnt quite the recommend choice than it once was,1,0.9825906181425572,1
18,one is that its a more affordable option than the iphone 11 699 at apple with surprisingly similar camera specs which it is,1,0.9933464438059517,1
19,and yet once opened the device itself ,1,0.9754955607173577,1

23,still if you want a very small apple handset theres no alternative and the iphone se is still an alright phone and you can even update it to run ios 13,1,0.9972585225765963,1
24,or that its the 2020 sequel to the original se from 2016 which it also is,1,0.9859974313838757,1
25,the new lowercost iphone se ,0,0.9559118188198777,1
26,battery life could be better the screen tech is starting to age and some upgraders will miss the headphone jack but overall the smart improvements make this – for the price – one of the best iphones apple has ever made,1,0.9953073444085412,1
27,ios is excellent,1,0.9810893249606598,1

30,or at 47 inches that its the smallest and cheapest iphone you can currently buy,1,0.958148187628784,1
31,felt like a throwback to a simpler time when consumers stood in long lines on the street for a new gadget rather than toilet paper,1,0.9331152010848008,1
32,the iphone se 2020 is built around one goal to create a new iphone for less money than ever and it achieves that well,1,0.9924203319673889,1
33,not a great display for 400,1,0.9910211507806369,1
34,its our editors choice for smaller smartphones,1,0.9809932910729231,1
35,great camera,1,0.9929949710848228,1
36,or and this is my favorite way to think about it that its an iphone 8 with the brains and power of an iphone 11,1,0.9827047438590468,1
37,the se device which began shipping to customers on friday and comes in white black and red takes us back to 2017 when apple aapl launched the iphone 8,1,0.9831890169325997,1
38,for just 399  £419  au749 you can have a brandnew handset from apple – it’s one of the best iphones ever created and you can now get your hands on one,1,0.9928044978922309,1
39,battery life is just ok apple designs devices to last and not just because it pleases customers,1,0.9850671787414317,1
40,heres a quick rundown the iphone se has the same body screen and storage as the iphone 5s  at amazon ,1,0.9807806810741589,1
41,excellent performance,1,0.9690559533415739,1
42,in fact the new iphone se is all these things and thats why im enamored with it,1,0.9918016443090448,1
43,on the surface you could easily mistake the se for that threeyearold model with its design home button and bezel frame,1,0.9870534004395402,1
44,the design of the phone is going to be familiar to anyone that’s used an iphone recently – unless you’ve not held a handset from apple since 2013 then you’ll have seen this 47inch frame before complete with bezels top and bottom and a home button with fingerprint scanner built in,1,0.9917913121479865,1
45,it also lets apple polish up an old device with fresh specs and sell it as new,1,0.9869400469674307,1
46,it has the same modem touch id sensor with nfc for apple pay and front camera as the iphone 6 ,1,0.9853038933703068,1
47,solid battery life,1,0.9884944473995778,1
48,affordable price,1,0.9779321653574284,1
49,the new iphone se goes on sale in shanghai china ,0,0.8829197679488902,1
50,it’s now seen as the ‘smaller’ iphone form factor given the allscreen designs of the more recent models and it’s both more lightweight and pocketable than anything from the iphone 11 range,1,0.9853639870210957,1
51,the iphone se is the latest example but hardly the first,1,0.9802453185115695,1
52,and it shares a processor and rear camera with the iphone 6s 59999 with code vzwdeal at verizon wireless ,1,0.9824764690193856,1
53,average screen,1,0.9782231671698938,1
54,long battery life so far,1,0.9907308023796461,1
55,one of the only regions where apple stores are currently openthe new iphone se goes on sale in shanghai china ,1,0.9353708116000353,1
56,it’s pleasingly water resistant but does have some drawbacks thanks to the older design it lacks a headphone jack at the bottom and because the display technology is slightly dated as it comes from the iphone 8 it can suffer in bright light when you’re trying to watch videos or the like,1,0.9826083274009292,1
57,apple took a similar approach to the iphone 8 and still sells a macbook pro 13 with touch bar that’s essentially identical to the model launched in 2015,1,0.9878576828669335,1
58,these components add up to a phone that can run the latest apps without complaining and fits into a childs hand,1,0.9641743362777276,1
59,poor frontfacing camera,1,0.9704335533885124,1
60,great rear camera,1,0.9921042732502241,1
61,one of the only regions where apple stores are currently open,1,0.9718091156193034,1
62,apple might have stuck with the same design as the iphone 8 but the innards are much improved – notably the new a13 bionic chipset inside which adds speed nearly everywhere and really does improve the performance over the older 47inch models,1,0.9942214275207111,1
63,it’s a polarizing strategy and the new iphone se created a schism the moment it was announced for all the usual reasons,1,0.9510932524193582,1
64,from a design perspective the iphone se 13900 at amazon uses the iphone 5s body,1,0.9860405662907098,1
65,the iphone se is the last truly small iphone that apple launched,1,0.9955448597976984,1
66,iphone 11 prolevel performance,0,0.948877180287209,1
67,under the hood apple has stuffed the computing smarts of its flagship 61inch iphone 11 into the ses 47inch body making it arguably the most powerful budget device on the market,1,0.9809040646619369,1
68,it’s not quite at the level of the iphones launched last year but it’s not far off,1,0.9812787592169175,1
69,some see smart reuse of a great design that still has purpose,1,0.9857403618205323,1
70,that means it measures 487 by 231 by 030 inches hwd and weighs 40 ounces and has a brushedmetal back with glass panels at the top and bottom,1,0.9247515253626986,1
71,the same size as the older iphone 5s the se slips easily into a pocket and is supereasy to use onehanded,1,0.9886745740848237,1
72,dont like,1,0.9816996886721595,1
73,but its something else ,1,0.9675347510101273,1
74,that a13 chipset has improved the camera performance too despite no discernible change to the specs of the sensor since the iphone 8 there’s just a single lens on the iphone se 2020,1,0.994055882116431,1
75,others see lazy rebranding of an obsolete phone,1,0.911526363602812,1
76,theres a touch idequipped fingerprintsensing physical home button below the display,1,0.9854655850564804,1
77,now the handset is getting a little old and it’s increasingly hard to find with only a few refurbished models available,1,0.9872805949624827,1
78,old iphone design,1,0.9914699278515977,1
79,something harder to quantify with the specs you find on a typical product page ,1,0.9345566849114824,1
80,it takes decent bright photos that will please most people although it doesn’t quite offer the same color reproduction or clarity as the iphone 11 pro max for example,1,0.9922883151783843,1
81,people in both camps tend to have their opinion ready before ever laying hands on the phone in question,1,0.9715295044086882,1
82,the phone fits easily into iphone 5 or iphone 5s cases,1,0.9875834585768807,1
83,given that there doesn’t appear to be any sign that the iphone se 2 will ever be released is this still the small phone to buy,1,0.9897715445401093,1
84,selfie camera is mediocre,1,0.9758969075473588,1
85,that makes this device feel like it was made for exactly the moment we now find ourselves in intentionally or not,1,0.9846004206477165,1
86,the portrait mode doesn’t work as well as on phones that pack a second depthsensing sensor for precise bokeh effects  and as a result you can be left with some oddlooking fringing around the edges of subjects,1,0.9758860623422552,1
87,whatever your thoughts going in one fact is indisputable the iphone se 400 is the least expensive iphone and that makes it important no matter its design or hardware,1,0.9875921227472191,1
88,there are only two visible differences between this and the older phones theres a small se logo on the back and the beveled edges are matte rather than shiny,1,0.9872812319802108,1
89,for many people the answer will be yes,1,0.9731775548585413,1
90,the new iphone se has the classic design that defined the iphone for its first 10 years,1,0.9833041583215971,1
91,starting at 399 its by far the most affordable new iphone at a time when many households may struggle to justify the fourfigure price tags of apples flagship smartphones,1,0.9832632923489099,1
92,but overall the camera – and especially for the price – takes impressive pictures in most scenarios,1,0.9899129481972214,1
93,plenty of people will buy it because it’s the new default choice,1,0.9801684330527907,1
94,the phone also now comes in rose gold in addition to dark gray gold and silver,1,0.9521957670666517,1
95,thanks to the iphone se getting ios 13 it can run the latest operating system keeping it uptodate,1,0.9753971648566429,1
96,the design the body and the camera lenses are all the same as 2017s iphone 8,1,0.984706350250853,1
97,more than 26 million people are out of work in the us alone and many others may worry about joining those ranks,1,0.9568888793028258,1
98,battery life is probably one of the biggest issues we found with the iphone se 2020 – it’s not going to easily last you a day unless you’re a particularly light and sedate user,1,0.9957137511415461,1
99,i’ll get an awkward admission out of the way,1,0.9547654912838153,1
100,the iphone se also uses the same screen as the iphone 5s a 4inch 1136by640 panel that has 326 pixels per inch,1,0.9886587792418382,1
101,and if the size is the most important thing to you then this is the smallest iphone that you can get by a long shot,1,0.9814960296511711,1
102,but apple performed a clever brain transplant replacing the nearly 3yearold processor with the a13 bionic processor used in the iphone 11 11 pro and 11 pro max,1,0.9881418697196591,1
103,with its smaller screen and the return of features like a touch id button its immediately familiar when practically everything else in our lives is very much not,1,0.9866733549388239,1
104,given the number of powerhungry apps available that will make the most of all that power provided by the a13 chipset we would have liked to have seen at least an allday battery in there even for the lower price,1,0.985376473514294,1
105,as a tech reviewer you might expect me to upgrade my gear every year,0,0.8167463132494667,1
106,in terms of quality its pretty similar to the iphone 6 and 6s screens which are just bigger,1,0.991345920418521,1
107,yet there’s no getting away from the fact that the iphone se is now a little old and the iphone 8 is faster and a better choice for most people looking for a cheaper iphone while the iphone xr makes more sense if you want something with a more modern design and the iphone 11 can take care of your flagship needs,1,0.9977019991373338,1
108,this goes well beyond a simple spec bump by majorly improving things like the cameras and battery life,1,0.9742088507339604,1
109,and even some of the features that apple forfeits in the se feel oddly prescient and appropriate,1,0.9754959247372174,1
110,however don’t let that detract from the fact that the iphone se 2020 follows on from its predecessor by bringing you a new iphone with not a lot of compromise for less money than you might expect,1,0.9768178869121331,1
111,i don’t,0,0.948817933505609,1
112,these are highquality lcds that have made hundreds of millions of people happy over the years but its important to remember they arent leadingedge the screens on the samsung galaxy s7 19999 at samsung and the lg g5 62400 at verizon wireless  for example are brighter with richer colors and much higher pixel density making everything look more vibrant than it does on iphones,1,0.9729830158247036,1
113,iphone se design screen and audio – small but perfectly formed,1,0.9913044321795013,1
114,the new processor not only runs faster but it will likely futureproof the phone through years of ios updates,1,0.9897141196872684,1
115,after all what good is it to default to relying on facial recognition to unlock a device when so many of us now must cover our faces daily with masks,1,0.9606388316844614,1
116,while it doesn’t hit many heights in terms of power or performance it more than offsets that by being the cheapest iphone apple has ever launched while still packing refined and useful hardware making the new iphone se a splendid option for those either on a budget or just wanting to find an easy route into the apple ecosystem,1,0.9891063270474099,1
117,my everyday phone is an iphone 7 plus which despite lacking many knockout features you’ll find on more modern devices is still a nice phone,1,0.9925245583541613,1
118,the 4inch screen reduces usable real estate of course,1,0.9761522777246323,1
119,a surprising amount of people i speak to say they want a small phone that packs all the features of a fullfat flagship,1,0.9863873179731348,1
120,but a 399 £419 au749 iphone comes with compromises which apple chose wisely,1,0.9724844020529431,1
121,what you really need in 2020 is a device that lets you video chat and email and doesnt break when your toddler throws it on the ground,1,0.9763263177361167,1
122,the iphone se 2020 release date was friday april 24 with preorders going live the week before so you can now get your hands on apples latest handset if youre hankering for some lowprice iphone action,1,0.9697481895228246,1
123,the one thing i don’t like about it is a drawback it shares with the iphone se chunky bezels around the display,1,0.9908449875475881,1
124,reading an email in outlook i could see about 90 words on the ses screen as compared with 160 words on the iphone 6s 250 on the galaxy s7 and 360 on samsung galaxy note 5 ,1,0.9789917628468188,1
125,sony is the only manufacturer to have previously attempted anything like this but even its xperia z5 compact has a notsotiny 46inch screen and it’s quite thick,1,0.9576503553929407,1
126,the se has only a single rear camera it doesnt have face id and it lacks camera features like night mode slofies and deep fusion processing,1,0.9946706263650382,1
127,when we emerge from quarantine however well need something more,1,0.9837623926154442,1
128,the iphone se price starts at 399  £419  au749  rs 42500 meaning its the same price in the us as the original iphone se but higher in the uk,1,0.9837918370800846,1
129,they’re massive compared to other modern phones,1,0.9798723478861773,1
130,looking at a google sheet spreadsheet i could see 13 rows on the se as compared with 17 on the 6s 22 on the galaxy s7 and 27 on the note 5,1,0.9791768182423193,1
131,the iphone se is much smaller and much easier to handle,1,0.9891302280102728,1
132,the selfie camera is ok but not as amazing as the one found on the iphone 11 11 pro and 11 pro max,1,0.9941030691588258,1
133,the good news is the se is more than just a device thats nearly half the price of the 699 iphone 11 it works nearly as well,1,0.9947607025980152,1
134,the base model comes with 64gb of storage with 128gb and 256gb models also available for a higher price which you can see listed below,1,0.9787215601686872,1
135,every android competitor in this space offers slim bezels that maximum screen size for a given footprint,1,0.9763752139715292,1
136,that can be frustrating but it can also be liberating,1,0.9723853538960846,1
137,anyone who’s used an iphone 5 or iphone 5s will feel at ease with the iphone se – it looks and feels almost identical except now you can get it in a fetching rosegold colour and its cut edges are matte rather than shiny chrome,1,0.971051941806329,1
138,when you look at the complete picture the iphone se represents the most value for your dollar of any phone apple sells,1,0.9749239973697083,1
139,the specs youll care about whenever the pandemic ends,1,0.968945591824707,1
140,in the us apple is offering the new iphone se at 1662month through its financing plan or if you have something like the iphone 8 to tradein just 954mo or 229 – although if you’re upgrading from the original iphone se or iphone 6 youll only get 30 toward the full price of the device,1,0.991497920209701,1
141,can you live with them,1,0.9583723602752339,1
142,i used the se as my primary phone for a weekend coming off of a few months with a galaxy note 5 and discovered that you use them differently,1,0.9467719410094358,1
143,those phones have an iconic design and i have no problem with apple reusing it especially if it means they can keep costs down and pass the savings on,1,0.9806897535978244,1
144,it has an attractive price fantastic battery life great rear camera a13 processor water resistance and support for wireless charging,1,0.9925873091020528,1
145,this is apples secondgeneration iphone se,0,0.9418242634596213,1
146,the iphone se has exactly the same design and display as the iphone 8 from 2017,1,0.9902108497277525,1
147,certainly,1,0.9647697470365305,1
148,i found myself less likely to write long emails and social media messages on the iphone se than on the larger note 5 but more likely to quickly check various feeds and read news especially while doing something else,1,0.9776078311974741,1
149,the best thing about the design of the iphone se is that it still feels quality,1,0.9959812347953507,1
150,the se is not only a wonderful iphone but one of the best budget phones you can currently buy,1,0.9856339089696705,1
151,the original which sold for 399 when it was introduced four years ago packed the internals of the 47inch iphone 6 and the 55inch iphone 6s plus into the 4inch body of the iphone 5 serving as an alternative for people who didnt want a bigger device or the price tag that comes with it,1,0.9919211675009135,1
152,using this form factor and screen hardware allowed apple to keep the cost of the device as low as it has as it didn’t need to invest in a whole new manufacturing process,1,0.9843824068625688,1
153,i have for years,0,0.9480604706469296,1
154,the iphone se sat so firmly in my hand that i never felt like i was going to drop it the way i sometimes felt with the galaxy note 5,1,0.9835660187865712,1
155,the brushed aluminium back is both hard and cool to touch the buttons are solid and it’s easily small enough to use onehanded regardless of the size of your hands,1,0.9893535909552255,1
156,physically the se is an iphone 8,1,0.9745954706501951,1
157,now its back and so is the home button and touch id over the newer option to unlock through facial recognition,1,0.9797818547354786,1
158,it feels like the iphone world has moved on in three years though – that the 47inch screen with the chunky bezels above and below has been consigned to the past,1,0.9871611008686343,1
159,still this is easily the biggest problem with the iphone se’s design,1,0.9947990568933258,1
160,i commute with my tween daughter and she found it more comfortable to play games on the se than on the note 5—which is so big that she actually cant hold it safely in one hand,1,0.9702105057885935,1
161,iphone se 3 coming from using the giant iphone 6s plus and huawei mate 8 i also found it a relief to be able to bend my leg again when i put a phone in my front pocket,1,0.9771971491097079,1
162,the front and back are made of glass the chassis and sides are aluminum,1,0.9682395131613406,1
163,its hard to shake the habit of swiping up to close out of apps like you would on newer models but theres also something nostalgic about pressing a physical button again,1,0.9868549572514083,1
164,in that time the flagship iphone range has moved to an allscreen design – barring a notch at the top you’re presented with barely any bezels – while with more premium aluminum inside things have got a little weightier in recent years,1,0.977032465051068,1
165,you’ll feel a tinge of jealously when a friend pulls out a google pixel 3a or moto g stylus,1,0.9811132959765229,1
166,theres one real usability handicap i have always found the touch keyboards on 4inch iphones difficult to type on accurately,1,0.9751070487578997,1
167,in other ways it’s taken me time to adjust to the smaller screen,1,0.9835170345599922,1
168,the only physical difference between the iphone se and iphone 8 is that the apple logo is now centered on the back to match currentgeneration iphones,1,0.9875317350044918,1
169,the same is true of the smaller size screen though it can take some getting used to for those whove turned to larger devices in recent years,1,0.9923486041611983,1
170,so returning to the iphone 8 design means apple is bringing back its more lightweight phone and anyone upgrading from something like the first iphone se will feel less of a change than if they went for the behemothic but impressive iphone 11 pro max for example,1,0.9951606134178219,1
171,while the iphone se is replacing the iphone 8 its design is rooted in the iphone 6 — a phone that came out in 2014,1,0.982850203805687,1
172,autocorrect helps but trying to type passwords—especially because ios never displays passwords—can be frustrating,1,0.9601857244202956,1
173,it’s not just that i have to move it closer to my face to read text like my granddad reading the morning paper i also struggle with the small keyboard,1,0.9683635485363452,1
174,the new phone has apples oldschool forehead and chin bezel above and below the screen,1,0.9755588445186825,1
175,the display choice is striking too with less pixel density than whats on the iphone 11 and bezels around the frame that take up a good bit of screen real estate,1,0.9926310883264845,1
176,indeed picking up the new iphone se  the first thing you’ll notice is how lightweight it is,1,0.9880515868490644,1
177,it’s not unfair to say that the new iphone se looks like a sixyearold phone,1,0.9890006810584552,1
178,call quality here is similar to the iphone 6 voices are loud and solid through the earpiece with support for hd calling wifi calling and voiceoverlte volte,1,0.966781794976054,1
179,ironically i often have to use both my hands and thumbs on the phone to minimise the potential for embarrassing autocorrect fails,1,0.961419285360702,1
180,this makes the se look well old,1,0.9933494263597658,1
181,articles 4k videos and games once again compete for space with the black perimeter intact making the experience a bit less immersive,1,0.9185293364638836,1
182,again some might not notice the change if they’re coming from a smaller phone from 201617 but trust us it could have been a lot worse as the devices in the newer allscreen iphone ranges are a lot heavier,1,0.9780508540280436,1
183,thankfully that’s where the bad news ends,1,0.9644971797226951,1
184,the speakerphone is adequate but not spectacular,1,0.9361449050901507,1
185,i’ve gotten more used to it but i still don’t find it comfortable after a few weeks of using the phone nonstop,1,0.9848006977327132,1
186,this is the one of the few things that im not too thrilled about,1,0.9808287702837262,1
187,the new iphone se in redthe iphone se only has one rear camera lens compared to the two youll find on the back of the iphone 11 an extra for landscape shots and the three on the iphone 11 pro another for zoom effects,1,0.9974700464047298,1
188,while the iphone 8’s design might feel like an archaic choice for a new iphone it makes a lot of sense in the iphone se 2020 – and for some who don’t particularly care for the latest features this more familiar design will be a lot more desirable,1,0.9928072887958216,1
189,despite its bezels the iphone se remains a slim sleek pocketable device,1,0.9789376760820311,1
190,transmissions through the microphone on the tmobile volte network were clear and solid,1,0.9500858708605088,1
191,the small screen also means watching video is a little cramped and while the iphone se is more than powerful enough to play all the best games trying to manoeuvre precisely requires daintier digits than mine,1,0.9839719180821098,1
192,its not ugly its just dated,1,0.9478516550192947,1
193,but coupled with the new processor the iphone se can do more than youd think,1,0.9727361560054965,1
194,one suspects that if apple had rebooted the original iphone se shape with the smaller 4inch screen and clickable home button the new iphone se 2020 features a haptic button that doesn’t move but simulates the feel of a click with a small vibration it would still have sold well but the larger 47inch lcd screen is more useful for today’s apps which make good use of the extended display,1,0.9977939499471402,1
195,it’s 545 inches tall 265 inches wide 29 inches thick and weighs only 522 ounces making it the lightest of the current iphones,1,0.9348999986322353,1
196,there are two models of the iphone se,1,0.9915418554232514,1
197,this really is a tiny phone by modern standards,1,0.9662931113402401,1
198,and that might appeal to some people but not me,1,0.976987884556484,1
199,portrait mode on the selfie camera is especially notable considering the front camera system touts just one lens,1,0.989477074950126,1
200,one thing that many will miss is the 35mm headphone jack,1,0.982435024875265,1
201,the google pixel 3a which is among the smaller mainstream android phones is still a halfinch taller more than a 10th of an inch wider and a 10th of an inch thicker — though it does manage to weigh the same,1,0.9799757965187154,1
202,the model we tested—a1662 which apple refers to as simfree—is sold for att tmobile and verizon its also the model sold unlocked,1,0.9662179901193482,1
203,while the iphone se still looks good there are a couple of aspects of the design that aren’t perfect and others that feel dated,1,0.9909961963790339,1
204,welcome back large bezels,1,0.9713549880380428,1
205,pictures are crisp vibrant and can easily be adjusted with lighting tools depthoffield control and image stabilization,1,0.9635455756069891,1
206,we’ve been saying we miss this for many moons now but as the original iphone se or other cheaper phones that are 23 years old had this feature we can see it might still cause consternation,1,0.9795456643866423,1
207,you’ll find more of a difference when comparing the iphone se to a beefy android phone like the moto g stylus,1,0.994416972876945,1
208,it supports lte bands 123458121317181920252629,0,0.8507630860576549,1
209,for starters if you don’t use a case with the iphone se you might find the edges a little harsh particularly if you’re more used to the rounded metal sides on contemporary phone designs,1,0.9846471911502084,1
210,having used face id for the past couple years its a strange and familiar feeling to set up and use touch id,1,0.9840843390259933,1
211,whats noticeably lacking however is night mode and slowmotion selfies ,1,0.9777112868786542,1
212,while some phone buyers might have accepted this loss by now barely any handsets are being launched with the port now it might still be something of a shock for those using phones from a few years ago in spite of the plethora of true wireless earbuds,1,0.968430852092162,1
213,that phone which packs a 64inch display is threequarters of an inch taller a quarterinch wider and far thicker,1,0.9686095578681356,1
214,that notably leaves out sprints highspeed band 41 so a different unit a1723 is sold for sprint,1,0.9143014038571159,1
215,the screen bezel is also rather wide – especially at the top and bottom – and that means you don’t get a lot of screen for the size of the phone,1,0.9926337123582615,1
216,its like going from an automatic transmission back to a stick shift,1,0.9734850906801452,1
217,features that are hardly dealbreakers and would go mostly unused right now anyway,1,0.9651145664236253,1
218,apple has put its earpods in the iphone se box which use the phone’s lightning connector in place of the 35mm headphone jack but those who already have wired headphones that they’re happy with will need to spend 9  £9  au15 on an adapter,1,0.9651366255792124,1
219,it’s also about 30 percent heavier,1,0.9810268291533197,1
220,the simfree model also has the mostused basic lte roaming bands but not band 7 which boosts speeds on canadian and some european networks,1,0.9174545741035605,1
221,that’s not the only problem with the screen,1,0.9934704181314594,1
222,but in the right car stick shift can be a blast,1,0.9517983273378464,1
223,concerts are now held in rock stars living rooms rather than lowlit venues and theres only so much you can do creatively with a slofie from the confines of your couch,1,0.9283591227617252,1
224,the display on the iphone se 2020 might not be the most featurerich but it’s fine,1,0.9872123163670901,1
225,that’s a difference you’ll easily notice and i complained that the g stylus felt too heavy and thick in my review,1,0.9854540128761874,1
226,the iphone 6s has all the bands and recovers from dead zones much more quickly than the se,1,0.9677048846367574,1
227,it packs the exact same display as the 5s,1,0.9782900855600105,1
228,i forgot how much i missed the home button and how it makes interactions and navigation less fussy than swipes and holds,1,0.9678960429338319,1
229,apple unveils new budget iphonemeanwhile the ses battery life gets you solid usage through the end of the day although how much longevity you need from it now when a charger is always nearby isnt as critical as you would on a long commute home,1,0.9826721839599388,1
230,given the target market this phone is aimed at – those who want a new iphone but don’t want to spend a huge amount of money on one – there’s not really an expectation of a fancy oled display here,1,0.9903541501772019,1
231,as a small phone the iphone se answers the prayers of those preaching the path of onehanded smartphone use,1,0.9827687880737905,1
232,that said the iphone se is going to outperform both the iphone 5s and the iphone 6 but not the 6s on tmobile because it supports band 12 which has become very important for extended lte coverage,1,0.9795137517010187,1
233,while the 1136 x 640 resolution provides a perfectly sharp 326 pixels per inch the screen lacks punch and has a reddish tinge that is exacerbated when it’s tilted at some angles,1,0.9476941016962901,1
234,i tap and hold to pay for purchases instead of angling my phone to get face id verification,1,0.9610265746777914,1
235,it does feature wireless charging something you wont find on most budget devices,1,0.9810703320652013,1
236,the resolution of the iphone se screen might not be topend it’s far less sharp than more recent iphones or even a number of cheap android phones but it’s not something that’s really that obvious in most usecases,1,0.9955801392841234,1
237,i’m 6 feet 1 inch and never needed two hands to use it — in fact placing two hands on it feels a bit silly,1,0.9857358740066223,1
238,the 5s and 6 dont have that band the 6s and se do,1,0.9860216504192738,1
239,compare it to samsung’s colourpacked super amoled screens or even the newer lcd technology on a phone like the htc 10 and it really starts looking its age,1,0.9413374189620244,1
240,a speedy doubletap shows recent apps,1,0.9569391759368231,1
241,in many ways the 399 model is a steal for what you get but as always the price ticks up if you want more than the default 64gb of storage,1,0.9827203875848556,1
242,the only thing that we would like to see improved is the brightness of the display in the years since the iphone 8 launch the color and vividity of the screens on phones has improved hugely and they appears brighter at default settings – and forcing the brightness right up has a strong and negative effect on the battery life,1,0.9793405092457056,1
243,owners under 5foot 4 inches might find reaching the top edge a stretch but the maneuver is still possible with a slight shimmy,1,0.9582992557639383,1
244,the iphone 6 and se should have similar performance to each other on the att and verizon networks,1,0.9838846319383442,1
245,still it’s quite acceptable – bright enough to be used outdoors and sharp enough to read websites on the go without noticing any fuzzy edges to letters,1,0.9644698056972967,1
246,though face id has its own benefits the home button is still as satisfying to use as it was back in the day,1,0.9935380123475976,1
247,it costs 449 for 128gb and 549 for 256gb the latter of which is still 150 less than the starting iphone 11 model,1,0.9657511753486753,1
248,that brightness does need to be increased a little too often as well – there’s no escaping the fact that this is an older display on offer with the iphone se 2020 and there were more than a few occasions when we needed to shelter the phone from brighter light to see what was on the screen – something that isn’t an issue with newer iphones,1,0.9957366622172511,1
249,in that sense the new iphone se falls short of the supreme onehanded utility of its 4inch predecessor,1,0.9692173756746545,1
250,the iphone se performs consistently better than the iphone 5s but not as well as the iphone 6s on wifi networks,1,0.9937283449148562,1
251,the speakers are decent,1,0.9516997802796273,1
252,for tiny phone lovers the iphone ses 47inch lcd display isnt as small as the original ses 4inch screen,1,0.9946328106679649,1
253,its also important to keep in mind the pandemic will likely have a significant impact on apples product plans for the year,1,0.967486400890691,1
254,the big change with the iphone se 2020 and we don’t use the italics lightly there is the upgraded engine from the iphone 8,1,0.9846009290723973,1
255,still it’s small enough that i don’t think most people will find this a problem,1,0.9951093004656129,1
256,while the se and 6s did about as well as each other within 25 feet of a wifi router the 6s offered better speeds on the edge of the wifi cell and in a very wifinoisy area,1,0.9691943958460003,1
257,the speaker located at the bottom of the phone is decent rather than outstanding,1,0.9654394065673336,1
258,but its still smaller than most phones out right now and is enough to be portable and comfortable for most people,1,0.9920034350555856,1
259,in the fall the company is widely rumored to be launching four iphone 12 models but some analysts suspect it could delay the launch of the muchanticipated 5g iphone until consumer appetite returns,1,0.9296521222375682,1
260,while the external design is nighon identical apple has supercharged the insides with an improved chipset running the show,1,0.9635000316759433,1
261,all the usual buttons are here power volume up and down and a physical switch for turning vibration on or off,1,0.9597908816530415,1
262,i got double the wifi speed of the se on the 6s in edge cases where both phones were stuck under 10mbps on a 100mbps connection,1,0.972160146015842,1
263,toplevel volume isn’t as high as some other phones but the quality of the audio output is surprisingly good from such a small package – sound is balanced if a little thin and there’s no distortion at the highest volume,1,0.9786438673239725,1
264,the screen on the se is similar to the one on the iphone 11 especially in terms of quality and resolution,1,0.9975304935153612,1
265,considering that device will likely cost well into the mid1000s it may be long past september before people feel comfortable spending that much on a gadget,1,0.9858058038706339,1
266,that extra power is designed to allow the new iphone se to rival the iphone 11 range in terms of speed when flipping between apps and editing snaps and video and should also improve the camera performance thanks to upgraded computational power from the new chipset,1,0.99308796070168,1
267,they’re all made of aluminum like the chassis and feel great to use,1,0.9908775724068352,1
268,thats to be expected because the 6s supports mimo and the 6 does not,1,0.9750124222371892,1
269,call quality is also strong,1,0.9860574509450772,1
270,text looks sharp colors are accurate and its bright in sunny conditions,1,0.9697761113031361,1
271,the iphone se may not be for everyone but its backtobasics approach is everything we need right now to meet our needs during the quarantine and whatever comes after,1,0.9752765353036277,1
272,apple looks to have implemented some serious performance improvements while keeping the cost of this phone down and that impression has been borne out in our experience with the iphone se it matched the iphone 11 pro max – the most powerful phone from apple on the market – for speed when exporting an imovie and actually compressed a 1080p fouranda half minute video at an almost identical speed,1,0.9844396260291822,1
273,the touch id sensor which provides flawless fingerprint login continues to serve double duty as a home button,1,0.9598017413121974,1
274,what does that all add up to,1,0.9316702660044948,1
275,the ear speaker is clear and loud and the noisecancelling mic does a good job of clearing up any distracting external noises when you’re on a call,1,0.9527227797528389,1
276,the iphone se is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance,0,0.883701367995895,1
277,we compared it to the older iphone 8 plus with the same test and when compressing and exporting a movie down to a smaller size the iphone se 2020 managed the task so much quicker,1,0.9870521066237568,1
278,this a subtle but significant design choice,1,0.9697607526584793,1
279,a theme perhaps if youre upgrading from the iphone 4s or 5 or comparing this phone with a samsung galaxy s5  youre going to get much better coverage and internet speeds on the se,1,0.9737810885435629,1
280,there are louder call speakers out there but i didn’t have any problems hearing or making myself heard even on windy days with lots of traffic noise around me,1,0.9428393975880215,1
281,the iphone se is rated ip67 meaning it can withstand being submerged for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter about 3 feet,1,0.9414046966108066,1
282,if you’re going to tax the phone to its limits then the iphone 11 pro handsets are more able to handle graphically intensive tasks and apps  but even when playing more powerful games like pascal’s wager we didn’t feel the new iphone se losing any performance,1,0.9875913707692159,1
283,because it has a home button the iphone se doesn’t use the new gesture navigation system found on other new iphones,1,0.9945954429615392,1
284,if youre comparing it to an iphone 6 youll be about on par,1,0.9807654790095544,1
285,neither the design screen or sound quality excites the blood much – so far the iphone se isn’t very different at all when compared to its predecessors,1,0.9897345198864065,1
286,i wasnt able to test this claim though i did submerge it in a liter of water for 30 minutes and everything worked fine,1,0.9612153063801067,1
287,the average user will notice little difference unless intentionally trying to tax the se 2020,1,0.978164357757396,1
288,i like this,1,0.9882040086504283,1
289,small size big powerthe iphone se uses the same apple a9 processor that the iphone 6s does running at 19ghz with 2gb of ram,1,0.9883069567732407,1
290,that all changes though when i scratch the surface and take the camera for a spin around london,1,0.9686003463585662,1
291,this level of water and dust resistance isnt something you normally find on phones under 400 so its particularly noteworthy that the iphone se has it,1,0.9736464584531449,1
292,whats interesting is the way that the iphone se has been angled by apple in terms of power output,1,0.9838021366141583,1
293,gesture controls are clearly the new normal but i like having the button which i think is more intuitive,1,0.9787760144698492,1
294,its processor power benchmarks exactly like the 6s—which is by the way 75 percent faster than the iphone 5s,1,0.9852732877469474,1
295,the se comes in three colors black white and red,1,0.9782449185254767,1
296,our benchmark testing showed that the newest iphone doesnt quite have the raw grunt or speed of the iphone 11 range suggesting that apple is balancing power output with battery performance,1,0.9843051520496894,1
297,as for ports well you get a lightning connector – a proprietary dead horse that i don’t feel the need to dig up and flog,1,0.9539991790492685,1
298,the powerful gpu means that onscreen graphics benchmarks tend to hit vsync the 60 frame per second limit beyond which screen images generally tend to tear and skip,1,0.9511257823116627,1
299,the iphone 8 had its own red version too but it had white bezels and damn if the iphone se doesnt look more striking in red with black bezels,1,0.9708377246265703,1
300,you can see the same thing on the iphone 11 vs the iphone 11 pro  small differences in benchmark scores likely in a bid to make sure each experience is tailored to different target users,1,0.9875398776663349,1
301,just know that you’ll need either wireless audio or a lightningto35mm audio adapter which isn’t included in the box,1,0.962731828022608,1
302,the a9 processor enables handsfree hey siri voice commands which i find much more usable than holding down the home button,1,0.9624167829249232,1
303,the iphone ses battery life is longer than the iphone 8,1,0.9943929965606785,1
304,those interested in the pro model will want the absolute max power which is why theres a larger battery to compensate but the more regular user might be fine with more of a balance  the new iphone se also appears to have 3gb of ram rather than the 4gb the iphone 11 is packing again minimizing costs,1,0.9899365855347941,1
305,the iphone se has a 47inch ips multitouch display that serves up a 1334 x 750 resolution or 326 pixels per inch,1,0.9713341567454739,1
306,it also enables apples animated live photos which can now be shared on facebook,1,0.9706193274524771,1
307,apples website says that the iphone ses battery lasts about the same as the iphone 8 but my testing showed it lasted much longer,1,0.9836755874676659,1
308,we experienced very little in the way of slowdown during our time with the new iphone se – apart from in the camera where the phone took a second or two to process each image we took,1,0.988579067514878,1
309,it’s a true tone screen meaning it adapts to the light in your environment with wide color support haptic touch and reaches a maximum brightness of 625 nits per apple,1,0.9717228951520469,1
310,the se runs ios 93,1,0.9804970024352808,1
311,i played a looped video on airplane mode at 50 brightness and the iphone se lasted 15 hours 45 minutes,1,0.9728910167335568,1
312,that’s not a huge problem in the grand scheme of things but if you want to instantly check out a snap you’ve taken it takes the shine off somewhat,1,0.9735987208248683,1
313,is a 47inch screen too small for a smartphone sold in 2020,1,0.9942398909717695,1
314,its our editors choice for mobile operating systems if only because unlike with android ios devices get frequent updates and are free of carrier bloatware,1,0.9676315901050235,1
315,thats hours longer than what the iphone 8 and iphone se lasted in the same test when they were new,1,0.9931259000479379,1
316,it’s hard to know what else to say about the upgraded chipset especially when we don’t know the amount of ram that it’s teamed with which will have an impact on the performance of some apps in the future but based on sidebyside comparisons we couldn’t fault the power of the new cheaper iphone,1,0.9591152945526075,1
317,no … but it’s close,1,0.9599684786055402,1
318,thirdparty apps especially games and social networks still tend to come to ios first and the apps are still often betterlooking and betterdesigned,1,0.9876399099640085,1
319,anecdotally it made it through a day and a half without a problem and a couple times it went two days straight without a charge,1,0.9732733996659745,1
320,in our view the makeorbreak feature for the iphone se – and so the key focus of this review – is the iphone se camera and how well it performs in day to day use – given that there’s ‘old’ hardware on offer here apple has taken a gamble that it can improve photo quality using image processing powered by the a13 bionic chipset,1,0.9949334939083276,1
321,this is an undeniably small screen next to what you might find elsewhere,1,0.9846558209342035,1
322,the price of that smoothness of course is that ios has a more rigid layout than android does and pushes you into using apples services whenever possible,1,0.9723533855381844,1
323,in our early battery tests the iphone se easily outlasts the iphone 8 and original 2016 iphone se,1,0.989323416562252,1
324,spoiler alert the gamble has paid off handsomely,1,0.9149176896963949,1
325,plenty of android competitors offer 62inch to 65inch screens for the same price and some might even be oled,1,0.982608710867347,1
326,yeah sure amazon music and google photos work on iphones but apple music and icloud photo library work better for instance allowing you to upload photos to the cloud in the background,1,0.976643251978826,1
327,i should note that i have more battery tests to run including streaming video tests so check back when ill update the results,1,0.9820140190474271,1
328,the new iphone se goes toetotoe with the iphone 11 pro max in terms of general snapping and only struggles when it comes to the areas where the hardware is lacking,1,0.9889503271541424,1
329,i won’t say those displays look more “realistic” but they’ll please your eye in a way the iphone se’s 47inch ips screen can’t match,1,0.9833331656682375,1
330,you also still have to put all of your apps on your home screens and cant have anything on your home screens except apps which is less flexible and powerful than the myriad widgets that android offers,1,0.9876354546128369,1
331,the iphone se has wireless charging which is another feature not found on most budget phones,1,0.9841937349753338,1
332,we’ll explain more about that in a moment but we’ve compared the iphone se 2020 to the iphone 11 pro max the iphone xs max and the iphone 8 plus and it holds its own well,1,0.9922667833746034,1
333,they’re bigger of course and often have a punchier more vibrant look,1,0.9838221648490159,1
334,back to the se itself though if you have an iphone 5 or an iphone 5c  at amazon  you may have noticed your phone slowing down a bit with ios 9,1,0.9899449858732026,1
335,there is also support for fastcharging which replenishes the battery to 50 in 30 minutes,1,0.9803668170097516,1
336,before we go into more detail about the camera’s performance let’s look at the hardware the iphone se camera is basically using the same set of lenses and megapixel count as the iphone 8 with a 12mp camera a sixelement lens and a sapphire glass cover for strength,1,0.979177805464162,1
337,let me put it another way,0,0.9188424398417706,1
338,its not really planned obsolescence on apples part but rather that newer oses simply assume newer processors,1,0.8945802261582186,1
339,but the iphone se doesnt come with the necessary 18watt charger and instead includes the slower 5watt one,1,0.976418051030032,1
340,we don’t know the exact sensor that’s being used  apple wouldn’t confirm whether it had upgraded the hardware there  but the same 12mp camera and f18 aperture remains so it seems that there’s very little change to the sensor,1,0.9802258960009586,1
341,the new iphone se’s screen is about 23 percent smaller than a google pixel 3a’s and 40 percent smaller than that of a moto g stylus or samsung galaxy a51,1,0.9931822696462017,1
342,switching to an se futureproofs you through around ios 12,1,0.977936385546744,1
343,again this is likely to keep the cost of the device low,1,0.9837576113721612,1
344,however apple has kept the same hardware specs for the ‘normal’ wideangle lens on the iphone range since the iphone 8 but hugely improved the quality of the pics – which suggests the processor is doing a lot of the heavy lifting,1,0.9858228036832152,1
345,it’s also 33 percent smaller than that of apple’s iphone 11,1,0.9902013262982916,1
346,the iphone ses battery life is the best ive ever seen on an iphone,1,0.9952052901977685,1
347,iphone se has a13 bionic processor performance,1,0.9902451005293411,1
348,so just how much difference does imbuing the iphone se with the same a13 bionic chipset complete with that improved image signal processor inside make,1,0.9903132856527112,1
349,it’s a lot smaller than other phones you’ll be looking at in this price bracket,1,0.990340585277688,1
350,thats because of the combination of the energyefficient modem and processor the small screen and the 1642mah battery which is slightly larger than the 1560mah cell in the iphone 5s,1,0.9758025806386367,1
351,the longevity of apples ios support for older devices is a quiet but significant appeal of owning an iphone,1,0.9736892408015688,1
352,the short answer is a lot,1,0.9603636840066049,1
353,i didn’t have a problem using it on a daily basis,1,0.9692473788452042,1
354,in our standard battery test which streams a fullscreen video continuously over lte we got 6 hours on the iphone se as compared with about 45 hours on the iphone 6 and 6s and 25 hours on the iphone 5s,1,0.9814492936427739,1
355,the iphone 8 and its a11 processor are now twoandahalf years old and will likely stop receiving ios software updates a couple years before the iphone se and its newer a13 bionic processor,1,0.9834362488942859,1
356,put photos from the iphone se 2020 next to snaps taken with the iphone 8 plus for example and you can instantly see improved sharpness more accurate color reproduction and an overall ‘better’ photo whether taken in brighter or darker conditions,1,0.9848879827895819,1
357,in fact normal daytoday use is where the smaller size feels more comfortable,1,0.9866734458757418,1
358,in a reallife test i got 13 hours of solid use out of the phone including gaming taking pictures surfing the web and making phone calls before it needed a recharge,1,0.9765873175230586,1
359,in performance tests the iphone se was consistently better than the iphone 8 and no surprise the original iphone se,1,0.9911263307988979,1
360,apple’s ‘tuning’ of images from the new iphone se – the way it thinks a photo should look – is interesting with the processing appearing to follow in the footsteps of that in the iphone 11 range favoring a coolerlooking scene,1,0.957949989137556,1
361,the new iphone se is a great device for thumbing out a quick text reply snapping a couple photos or popping up yelp to see what food is nearby,1,0.9773187401749356,1
362,the ses main camera is the iphone 6ss 12megapixel camera and it has the same pluses and minuses,1,0.977130795487936,1
363,it scored similar results to what we got on the iphone 11 11 pro and 11 pro max,1,0.9908087062558166,1
364,this results in images that look less warm compared to those from even the iphone xs from 2018 which to our eye are more visually appealing but the processing does produce snaps with good levels of sharpness and clarity,1,0.971175933137345,1
365,it’s small nimble easy to reach and displays just enough information to get the job done,1,0.9426478411280493,1
366,compared with just about every phone camera except for the galaxy s7 its very fast and takes sharp pictures in good light with true colors,1,0.9947472209226017,1
367,in real life that meant app launches were peppy playing games like sky children of light and doomsday vault were a breeze,1,0.932174561508619,1
368,in a sidebyside comparison with the iphone 11 pro max the most featurepacked phone apple has ever created the iphone se doesn’t perform as well… but that’s understandable for the price,1,0.9943367916420064,1
369,the longer i used the device though the more i felt constrained,1,0.9848156322227731,1
370,it also records 4k video at 30 frames per second as well as slowmotion video at up to 240 frames per second in 720p,1,0.9840983262465363,1
371,editing photos was easy and i could even use graphicsheavy ar apps such as wonderscope which transformed my bedroom into a training ground for ghosts,1,0.9618653258830164,1
372,it’s clear that the se has a tendency towards overexposing in some scenarios with some of the color and vividness lost in a few pictures,1,0.9567643977397594,1
373,this starts on the home screen where apps are icons sit noticeably closer together than on most iphones,1,0.9728061743906321,1
374,but as with the iphone 6s the cameras lowlight performance doesnt rule the roost,1,0.9760056171522073,1
375,the rear camera on the se has the same specs as the iphone 8 but when combined with the a13 chip and ios 13 it transforms the camera into something that can compete with the best phone cameras and even go toetotoe with the main rear camera on the iphone 11,1,0.9935356434405596,1
376,one in particular saw us having to massively drop the exposure of a nature scene taken under forest cover,1,0.9524767548395525,1
377,text can be harder to read since it’s smaller and you’ll need to scroll more while navigating websites,1,0.9719219755558947,1
378,the samsung galaxy note 5 and the galaxy s7 both take brighter shots with better color balance when the lights go down,1,0.9894321352963478,1
379,it has a slew of features including smart hdr for photos quick take filming and portrait mode  these are impressive features and a first for a 399 iphone,1,0.9904473227118298,1
380,despite the darker conditions the image was far too bright – it seemed the new iphone se camera was trying too hard to compensate,1,0.9871592202260848,1
381,then there’s video,1,0.98966790475149,1
382,the 12megapixel frontfacing camera is the iphone 6s camera plus apples new selfie flash feature which dials up the screen brightness to improve image quality in low light,1,0.9936733194808774,1
383,the iphone se has a single rear camera that has smarthdr and portrait mode for photos,1,0.9943682493826643,1
384,we often found that the images on the viewfinder were much brighter than in real life which usually meant we had to tweak the exposure,1,0.9757327104045501,1
385,mobile video consumption is a big deal for many people and it’s a place the iphone se must make a sacrifice,1,0.9862828131157677,1
386,in good light its fine in low light things can still get grainy enough that it almost looks an impressionist painting,1,0.9826664252236941,1
387,the rear camera on the se has a 28mm f18 lens while the iphone 11 has two rear cameras a main wideangle camera with a 26mm f18 lens and an ultrawideangle camera with a 13mm f24 lens,1,0.9820148884231243,1
388,however in a direct comparison with the best iphone on the market there wasn’t as much of a difference as the massive gulf in terms of price tag would suggest,1,0.984870286215449,1
389,viewing a video on the 47inch display isn’t nearly as enjoyable as it is on a larger 64inch or 65inch screen,1,0.9888843221821959,1
390,if you want a powerful small smartphone the iphone se is by far your best choice,1,0.9964291925625184,1
391,i do enjoy the ultrawideangle on the iphone 11 but i didnt miss it during my time with the iphone se,0,0.9760969570996147,1
392,you don’t get things like night mode which is superb and worth looking into if you’re considering the iphone 11 or the additional ultrawide and 2x zoom cameras,1,0.9897521270610884,1
393,even the 55inch display on my iphone 7 plus is in another league,1,0.982860045140219,1
394,it is both smaller and faster than its viable android competitors the 47inch alcatel one touch idol 3 47 12400 at amazon and the 5inch htc one a9 15500 at amazon ,1,0.9732445767919102,1
395,when i compare photos taken with each phone its hard to distinguish between them unless you bring them onto a larger screen and even then the differences are subtle,1,0.9841137070985599,1
396,in terms of the image quality you do get the differences are small but still there to see,1,0.9946206824624783,1
397,while the iphone se’s display left me precisely as whelmed as i’d expected its audio quality delivered a surprise,1,0.9811214370662675,1
398,notice that to find any android competitors at all i needed to stretch up to a considerably larger screen size,1,0.987148807751769,1
399,in good light photos from each are similar in terms of image quality,1,0.9964311132962658,1
400,not all the tricks have come off – for instance the depth of field capabilities on the iphone se aren’t as strong due to the aforementioned lack of a depthsensing lens,1,0.9292880667527631,1
401,this little phone can rock,1,0.9789501062255014,1
402,and its so much faster with much better wireless performance than the iphone 5s or 5c that people with those phones should consider upgrading right now,1,0.9942563976151342,1
403,look at the pictures below of a tree i took in my backyard,1,0.9675756486163063,1
404,this means portrait mode doesn’t always quite work out the edges of the subject and it can only manage to use the background defocusing on humans not on objects,1,0.981371940309141,1
405,the iphone se delivers stereo playback with enough volume to fill a living room with sound,1,0.9566754922099808,1
406,along with small android phones like the idol 47 and the a9 the iphone se also throws the iphone 6 off the bus,1,0.9833386057890032,1
407,can you tell the difference,0,0.8935850944951427,1
408,the new iphone se camera will blur around the edges of a subject at times meaning using one of the smart effects like stage light mono look quite strange with parts of the hair missing at the sides,1,0.9893403963058296,1
409,there’s even a hint of bass which opens the soundstage and reduces distortion during complex tracks,1,0.9403271451769648,1
410,theres really no reason to get the middling iphone 6 any more—the se delivers more power for less money,1,0.9842302070525051,1
411,you see my point,0,0.9180212267889042,1
412,it’s not terrible but it’s not easy to get the smartlooking snaps apple uses in its marketing,1,0.95673253824043,1
413,listening to lofi hiphop beats i noticed a depth of sound that i don’t often hear in a midrange smartphone,1,0.956057865805756,1
414,if you want to step up in screen size get an iphone 6s or an iphone 6s plus 74900 at verizon wireless ,1,0.9927029673052092,1
415,the most obvious difference is that the iphone se photo is framed tighter than the iphone 11,1,0.9869270410323048,1
416,while any phone that can algorithmically work out a subject using machine smarts alone is impressive there’s a gulf in quality between a portrait mode photo taken with a phone with twocameras compared to a single sensor,1,0.9893184738605438,1
417,it sounds like an older oontz speaker i frequently use though the iphone se’s maximum volume is much lower,1,0.986925118048683,1
418,most people i think will want a larger window to the internet,1,0.9672659005763088,1
419,here are a few other photos from the iphone se,1,0.9950037019266371,1
420,elsewhere the lowlight detail isn’t as robust and the color reproduction is behind that of the behemothic iphone 11 pro max,1,0.9746139706478922,1
421,the clear midrange helps in movies as well,1,0.9813781189831328,1
422,thats one reason why the 55inch samsung galaxy s7 edge remains our editors choice for smartphones overall,1,0.9887751031283109,1
423,the iphone se is great at capturing accurate colors,1,0.9830118035357698,1
424,but when you consider the relative cost of the phones and the fact that the new iphone se is about a third of the price of the 11 pro max it’s easy to forgive some of these mild deficiencies and instead be impressed that apple has managed to improve things so well just by putting a new engine inside what is in many respects an old handset,1,0.9899694736955496,1
425,big explosions and deep bass soundtracks tend to wreck smartphone speakers with smaller and less expensive phones suffering the worst of it,1,0.9699552470625804,1
426,but im willing to create a new category here to give the iphone se a prize,1,0.9696614620083444,1
427,smart hdr is impressive in keeping the sky from blowing out and the shadows relatively free of image noise,1,0.9592269861758183,1
428,the frontfacing camera a 7mp affair has also been given smarter capabilities you’re able to take the aforementioned portrait mode pictures meaning the background blurs away and you can arrest the world with only your dazzling features,1,0.9749213993189754,1
429,the iphone se isn’t free of muffled dialogue particularly in action scenes where explosions and dialogue often occur simultaneously but it does better than most,1,0.9598438406088077,1
430,let the iphone se be known as our first editors choice for small smartphones and lets hope that other manufacturers start to give apple some real competition,1,0.9746909334324566,1
431,in this photo of wood slats look at the amount of detail and texture the iphone se captured,1,0.9750936816670579,1
432,there’s no ‘slofie’ read slowmotion selfie video option here and we can’t say we miss it – although that may just be because we’re still slightly sickened by the invention of the word ‘slofie’,1,0.9762282795505158,1
433,and yes it’s a huge upgrade for anyone still stuck on the original iphone se,1,0.9780612856691728,1
434,the apple iphone se is the best choice if youre looking for a small but powerful smartphone,1,0.9970720767420238,1
435,a nice snap of my breakfast taken under medium lighting,1,0.9317667342892882,1
436,the quality of the images is good – they’re sharp and clean and even look decent in lowlight too,1,0.9894538377019974,1
437,as mentioned there’s no 35mm audio jack here so you’ll need wireless audio or a lightningto35mm audio adapter to use external audio devices,1,0.9766618661833916,1
438,both phones have portrait mode and produce excellent results,1,0.9875962383402077,1
439,apple has applied its photography algorithms well here and improved the capability of the frontfacing camera to take smooth welllit photos,1,0.9783494313686,1
440,glance at the specs and the iphone se’s camera doesn’t look impressive,1,0.9929697439404197,1
441,the 11 can capture portrait mode photos of both people and pets,0,0.9860765228480911,1
442,again using any of the portrait mode options will mostly lead to a closelycropped image with hair looking somewhat unnatural or blurred – but standard selfies come out well,1,0.9805889519984873,1
443,it’s a singlelens system with a 12mp shooter,0,0.8590151027016457,1
444,the iphone se like the iphone xr 599 at apple can only do people,1,0.9920199773442117,1
445,in terms of video too the overall power of the iphone se 2020 is as good as anything apple is offering elsewhere in its lineup you can shoot 4k video at up to 60 frames per second fps,1,0.9939115064504122,1
446,it has optical image stabilization portrait mode panorama mode and smart hdr among other features but none of that truly stands out,1,0.9810015477713698,1
447,its not until you look very closely at the photos below that you can see that the iphone 11s portrait mode captures just a bit more detail and less noise,1,0.9840698175025097,1
448,the 60fps option should only be used in good light though as movies will look dark in lower light,1,0.9863007248025781,1
449,apple claims the secret sauce is its image pipeline powered by the powerful a13 bionic’s neural engine,1,0.9611694237466942,1
450,in the picture below of my shoulder youll notice the quality of the falloff from infocus to outoffocus areas looks more natural on the iphone 11 than on the iphone se,1,0.9804700944002666,1
451,the slickness of the footage looks a bit odd – it almost looks too slick – but it gives a nicer look for fastmoving scenes,1,0.9453272129372013,1
452,and you know what,0,0.9140953980615497,1
453,below are photos of my bike trainer taken indoors in medium lighting,1,0.9658072738688325,1
454,the new iphone se battery size hasn’t been announced by apple it never reveals this spec but we do know that the iphone 8 came with a 1821mah power pack and we anticipate something similar for the iphone se 2020,1,0.9889495090583663,1
455,it’s good sauce,1,0.972013739078855,1
456,the most obvious difference here is the framing is tighter on the iphone se,1,0.974155889945017,1
457,and if that is indeed the case then it’s a potential issue because the iphone 8 didn’t have stellar battery life – it could just about last a day in normal use with the charger needing to be in reach towards the end of the evening,1,0.9868481532452432,1
458,this is all the camera i’ll ever need on a phone,1,0.9916756714409467,1
459,but the iphone 11 captured more detail which you can see on the wall outlet,1,0.9676156870065016,1
460,the new iphone se should in theory have a longerlasting battery as it’s got a more efficient engine at its heart and ios 134 is better at managing power consumption,1,0.9803534098964719,1
461,the new se takes pleasing outdoor photos,1,0.9857133613718844,1
462,and if you look at the bottom right side of the trainer youll notice the iphone se suffers from noise in the shadows,1,0.9861510580970185,1
463,however apple says the iphone se “lasts about the same as iphone 8” which is surprising and suggests that you should see about 24 hours’ less battery life in normal use than an iphone 11 and up to 25 hours less if just using the iphone for audio,1,0.9949447157985727,1
464,i wouldn’t call its look neutral but the iphone se is less prone to dramatic vibrant shots than most android phones,1,0.9866280011282929,1
465,that said there isnt a huge difference between the photos,1,0.9844423513134466,1
466,in practical use we saw a mixed performance from the new iphone in terms of battery life it certainly wasn’t in the same poweruse bracket as the impressive iphone xr and iphone 11 range and we found ourselves having to regularly reach for the charger in the evening,1,0.9906665944317965,1
467,that can leave the iphone se looking flat but the iphone largely avoids excessive color saturation,1,0.9723259552307071,1
468,for indoor and medium light photos the 11 has a thin edge,1,0.9694879045416825,1
469,however on lowusage days where we didn’t use the iphone for a heavy amount of photography or web browsing we got to the end of the day with over 30 left in the tank and we saw little powerdrain overnight too suggesting that the iphone se is pretty powerefficient in standby mode,1,0.9740322571760093,1
470,photos look realistic and balanced,1,0.9732086965592799,1
471,as for video both phones are similar,1,0.9916570809052231,1
472,but overall we felt that the iphone se was indeed a throwback to the older 47inch iphone models where it just felt like the power pack inside wasn’t big enough to comfortably last the day – we definitely didn’t have the confidence in this handset that we’ve come to enjoy with more recent iphones,1,0.991819651374543,1
473,i must praise the new se’s ability to handle bright lighting,1,0.9610901684735585,1
474,the iphone se and 11 can shoot 4k 60fps video but only the 11 takes advantage of the extended dynamic range at that resolution and frame rate,1,0.98702644220128,1
475,however if you’re coming from an original iphone se or older iphone model you won’t notice any issue and you’ll probably see a slight improvement – it’s just a shame that this feels like an opportunity to improve things that apple has surprisingly missed,1,0.9938197793245634,1
476,this is a place where midrange android phones often fall short,1,0.9846686218504693,1
477,the se has extended dynamic range for video but only up to 4k 30fps,1,0.9821464058145153,1
478,one way of alleviating this issue is to invest in a fast charger,1,0.978684699931873,1
479,it’s not perfect but blue skies are less likely to overwhelm a photo’s background and the new se usually settles on the right white balance without the need for finicky adjustments,1,0.9857596983980967,1
480,take a look at my iphone se review video to see samples of videos captured with the iphone se,1,0.9838583388218496,1
481,anything with usbc pd or 18w power delivery such as the charger that comes in the box with the iphone 11 pro and is available for an extra 29  £29  au49 will charge the phone rapidly – we’re talking getting you from empty to over 50 in around 30 minutes,1,0.97241307300709,1
482,i was less inspired by the new se’s indoor quality,1,0.9794323658091102,1
483,the one place where theres a big difference between the two phones are the selfie cameras,1,0.993671122726287,1
484,the overall charging speed is around one hour and 50 minutes for a full deadto100 recharge but the 5w charger that comes in the box will be a lot slower,1,0.9760258935221205,1
485,the phone still settles on the right white balance,1,0.9899767403760754,1
486,the iphone 11 has a wider frontfacing camera and its capable of shooting 4k and slowmo videos,1,0.9699733000284433,1
487,we’d suggest picking up a fast iphone charger from apple or anker to suit your speedier charging needs,1,0.9633550988552124,1
488,however its tendency to take neutral realistic shots can leave some photos looking flat,1,0.9829081974953943,1
489,the iphone se only shoots 1080p video and no slofies,1,0.979013567919357,1
490,then again you could buy a wireless charger instead as the iphone se 2020 is qicharging enabled,1,0.9791608391945212,1
491,this is a different problem from the noisy grainy images you’ll see on a subpar smartphone camera,1,0.9849400455755044,1
492,both have portrait mode for selfies but photos from the iphone 11 show more detail in my skin,1,0.9892430351285555,1
493,grab a cheap wireless pad or two for home and when eventually at work and you’ll never have an issue with power levels again,1,0.9803471392982044,1
494,i think the photos look plenty sharp,1,0.9891552108648247,1
495,it’s not ideal – we’d rather the iphone could just easily last a day without you needing to reach for the charger giving you some breathing room going into the next day or in case of emergency but that’s not the case here for some reason,1,0.9838560449227178,1
496,they just lack the wow factor you might see from a flagship smartphone,1,0.9579568697351116,1
497,should i buy the iphone se,0,0.9710940370849199,1
498,however i still think the new se performs well for its category and you can take excellent indoor photos,1,0.9934082087022451,1
499,this is easily the bestvalue handset from apple yet,1,0.9843990638961505,1
500,i don’t like to stage test photos and i did nothing to improve lighting,1,0.9837790861750494,1
501,not only is it the cheapest model but it comes with touch id a powerful engine that makes it fast and responsive under the finger and a decent camera all for nearly half the price of an iphone 11,1,0.9933744866594875,1
502,simply turning on a lamp will significantly improve your results,1,0.9569397141379904,1
503,you’re going to keep hold of it for a few years,1,0.9823401457045627,1
504,i can’t fault the iphone se’s lowlight performance,0,0.9596542372711893,1
505,the iphone se from 2016 was popular because it offered something novel at the time a new iphone for less cash than the existing models and that same idea has been offered with the latest modelwith the iphone se 2020 you’re likely to still get upgrades and security features for three to four years which will appeal to many who aren’t as bothered about having the very latest features,1,0.9873895656404983,1
506,color saturation and contrast remain wanting to be sure but i’m a little surprised by how clear and sharp these photos turned out,1,0.9786776534060744,1
507,if you want a new iphone but don’t want weight in the pocket then this is the model to go for,1,0.9844803556418481,1
508,you can see grain in the photo but it’s not so bad that the photo looks downright ugly – which is certainly true with some midrange phones,1,0.9788006321411146,1
509,it’s far less weighty partly it seems due to having less battery to lean on and is easier to wrap your fingers around than some models in the range right now,1,0.9766408577562284,1
510,remember however that the iphone se has no night mode or anything similar,1,0.9920646964917742,1
511,while the iphone se 2020 camera is strong it’s not the strongest in the range and it struggles in a few areas such as with exposure levels and depth of field effects,1,0.9798832622041431,1
512,if you try to take a photo outdoors at night you’re going to see a whole lot of nothing,1,0.978123778157611,1
513,however it’s still mightily impressive for the money and will impress those upgrading from much older phones,1,0.9860513163765666,1
514,as a singlelens shooter the iphone se lacks a zoom lens to help taking shots of faroff subjects,1,0.9619528721049142,1
515,we’re still not sure why apple has stuck with the battery life from the iphone 8 but it has,1,0.9949596462375293,1
516,it only supports digital zoom up to 5x,1,0.9350464381645665,1
517,it’s usable but given that the newer models are now able to much more easily last a day in normal use we expected more here – this is very much ‘stereotypical iphone battery life’,1,0.9941355685171247,1
518,yet i’m not sure that’s much of a disadvantage,1,0.9870971142609141,1
519,the screen on the iphone se 2020 dates back a few years being the same one that was used on the iphone 8,1,0.9948923295246934,1
520,adding an optical zoom lens felt like a big deal when it first came to phones but reception of the idea has cooled over time particularly if the lens is merely a 2x 3x or 5x zoom,1,0.9746878056554342,1
521,it’s not stellar in bright light and it lacks the sharpness of newer screens although the speakers are punchy to help improve the moviewatching experience,1,0.9643288316165678,1
522,i’ve found them hard to use and have largely come to ignore them when i’m not testing their quality,1,0.9867340186861472,1
523,i think the new se’s zoom performance is fine even solid for a midrange phone,1,0.9939231718572324,1
524,zooming all the way in certainly results in a quality hit but the photo is still sharp enough to be usable,1,0.9884057984933965,1
525,that’s better than some inexpensive phones i’ve tried,1,0.9862873962161578,1
526,the iphone se has a 7mp frontfacing camera and it didn’t impress me,0,0.9579722086418134,1
527,it struggles indoors often delivering grainy flat photos,1,0.9765116484502598,1
528,take it outdoors and it struggles with white balance and contrast,1,0.9773926768020658,1
529,it’s a functional shooter that can take good photos in ideal situations but it’s not great for snapping quick selfies,1,0.9804093708846044,1
530,the saving grace is the fact that all phones in this price range have similar issues,1,0.9834496881561339,1
531,portrait mode remains stunning,1,0.9786532961666975,1
532,suddenly photos from the frontfacing camera are elevated from disappointing to not bad,1,0.9674635967703865,1
533,the main camera meanwhile can take awesome portrait photos,1,0.9857932809247284,1
534,remember i am not staging the accompanying photos,1,0.9622909393571201,1
535,i’m not using any special lighting or even turning on a light in a room to make photos better,1,0.9921259010315326,1
536,despite that i’d be happy sharing the photos i took in portrait mode with friends,1,0.985522611354643,1
537,it’s not perfect,1,0.972256838349237,1
538,portrait mode is handled entirely in software and it can make mistakes,1,0.9496756585372952,1
539,look closely at my curly locks and you’ll see they’re sometimes blurred when they shouldn’t be a common problem for singlelens phones that attempt depth of field,1,0.9598268319579247,1
540,on the plus side you can manipulate the images after taking them in all sorts of ways,1,0.957059563796239,1
541,you can change lighting and aperture or omit the background entirely,1,0.9503003846448957,1
542,it all happens with surprising speed and is a lot of fun to play with,1,0.9202856708215245,1
543,the google pixel 3a is priced at 400 just like the iphone se and is often considered the champion of mid range phone photography,1,0.9897415980695646,1
544,fortunately i have a google pixel 3a xl so i could compare them headtohead,1,0.9786463052728238,1
545,i prefer the new se but it’s not a blowout,1,0.9748507777027324,1
546,i think apple’s phone does a better job with white balance,1,0.9892847070930781,1
547,this is most evident in the photo of the pizza logo against a partly cloudy sky,1,0.95108727244501,1
548,the iphone does a much better job delivering an accurate photo while the pixel 3a xl’s color temperature ends up too cool,1,0.9897792992385431,1
549,the new se also takes the lead in portrait mode,1,0.9942339295012773,1
550,i think image quality is comparable – but look at my ‘fro,1,0.9813090948812192,1
551,the pixel 3a xl’s algorithm is clearly less aggressive,1,0.9740807277135395,1
552,while the iphone blurs some wayward locks the pixel 3a gives me an odd halo,1,0.961985127825351,1
553,apple doesn’t win every photo though,1,0.9871452588390648,1
554,i prefer the pixel 3a xl’s photo of the lush garden sidewalk,1,0.9713341351030637,1
555,it’s more vibrant yet still looks natural,1,0.9839446270625598,1
556,you can almost smell the crisp spring air,1,0.9276413280364164,1
557,the iphone se’s photo is too flat and fails to capture my memory of the scene,1,0.9702201488292912,1
558,you might wonder what 4 years of progress will get you,0,0.8916230579419998,1
559,what’s the answer after pitting the 2016 and 2020 versions of the iphone se against one another,1,0.9792615382860597,1
560,a lot,0,0.94109334018158,1
561,the new se’s huge improvement in white balance and color temperature stands out most,1,0.9830146520918916,1
562,the original iphone se suffers in many outdoor situations,1,0.9840064094601871,1
563,it can’t even handle a cloudy sky,1,0.9716547546493007,1
564,this leads to overly bright images that lack color contrast depth and any other trait you’d associate with a good photo,1,0.9396432493838783,1
565,the indoor photo of a hearty slice of coffee cake shows less difference in lighting and color and you might confuse the photos from each se briefly,1,0.9692158969207232,1
566,look closer though and it’s obvious the new iphone se’s photo is much sharper,1,0.9939700023122611,1
567,portrait mode isn’t available on the original iphone se of course and that makes a big difference,1,0.9955891499527805,1
568,portraits from the new iphone se look sharper with better contrast and far better focus on the subject,1,0.9889973488497554,1
569,the new iphone se has a great smartphone camera,1,0.9974595479818549,1
570,i think it beats the google pixel 3a commonly considered the benchmark in this category by a hair,1,0.9725825895483681,1
571,it works well in most situations and can deliver some truly excellent shots,1,0.9770092385957457,1
572,i do somewhat miss the lack of any additional camera such as an ultrawide to improve versatility,1,0.9679032088850873,1
573,you can find that on some competing phones,0,0.9636262794563332,1
574,however those phones won’t keep up with the iphone se’s main camera,1,0.9948125151938348,1
575,what the new se lacks in versatility it makes up for by snapping solid shots with little preparation,1,0.980379447527857,1
576,you can shoot 4k video up to 60 frames per second on the iphone se or extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps,1,0.9916004387716287,1
577,optical image stabilization helps keep shots steady and digital zoom works up to 3x,1,0.9678195869957252,1
578,the phone also supports slomo 1080p video at up to 240 fps,1,0.9825808856860261,1
579,i don’t frequently shoot video on phones — or at all — so i’ll admit i’m not the best judge of quality,1,0.976577697757111,1
580,i think it looks great particularly at 4k,1,0.9868818225348539,1
581,i imagine most casual users will too,1,0.9464671857011202,1
582,professionals and enthusiasts may have a different opinion,1,0.9547895143662563,1
583,what stood out most wasn’t quality but speed,1,0.9751617538810604,1
584,the new se is a snappy performer even when recording 4k 60 fps,1,0.9794981493323252,1
585,there’s no lag to begin recording and no lag while recording,1,0.9570226353472244,1
586,that’s definitely not true for midrange phones some of which can’t shoot 4k at 60 fps,1,0.9875669664652518,1
587,apple’s decision to buy pa,0,0.8317040638545973,1
588,semi in 2008 easily ranks among the most important in the company’s history,1,0.9429476967046101,1
589,excellent performance is a key trait of apple phones and tablets across all price points,1,0.9704276833043779,1
590,the iphone se is a testament to that,0,0.9198389889003937,1
591,though it starts at 400 and is considerably smaller than other recent iphones the se has the same a13 bionic processor you’ll find in the iphone 11 and iphone 11 pro,1,0.9969263664604233,1
592,that’s paired with 3gb of ram,0,0.9375031037929015,1
593,the iphone se might be a midrange phone but its performance is equivalent to a flagship,1,0.9875463832516373,1
594,the new se’s singlecore geekbench 5 score of 1324 is nearly four times quicker than a google pixel 3a and its multicore score is nearly twoandahalf times better,1,0.975176337588162,1
595,the iphone se’s cpu easily defeats the more expensive google pixel 4 xl,1,0.984155939872915,1
596,it goes toetotoe with the samsung galaxy s20 ultra and the oneplus 8 pro winning in singlecore and nearly tying in multicore,1,0.9401241529168158,1
597,all this performance is thrown at a 47inch screen with a resolution well below 1080p,1,0.987430866319055,1
598,the iphone se doesn’t merely fly,1,0.9860862445241302,1
599,it shrieks through apps and games like a supersonic jet,1,0.9799658217353356,1
600,its performance is as close to perfect as i’ve ever witnessed,1,0.9817477729789233,1
601,it’s not just great,1,0.9851142636407438,1
602,it sets a new high bar for midrange phones one i doubt android competitors will hit within the next few years,1,0.9651520246361659,1
603,the iphone se doesn’t merely fly,1,0.9860862445241302,1
604,it shrieks through apps and games like a supersonic jet,1,0.9799658217353356,1
605,this is the part where i’d normally try to dig deeper and highlight a few nitpicks that detract from the experience,1,0.9352353474837419,1
606,not here,1,0.9390625,1
607,i have nothing to add,0,0.9174385644364329,1
608,it’s perfect,1,0.972256838349237,1
609,the basic 400 iphone se comes with 64gb of storage,1,0.9797560996152502,1
610,you can upgrade to 128gb for 450 or you can choose 256gb of storage for 550,0,0.7721016793185467,1
611,you’ll need to pick the right amount from the start because as with other iphones you can’t add more storage later,1,0.9820225182364416,1
612,unlike some past entrylevel iphones the new se’s base storage is adequate,1,0.9777080320592322,1
613,my iphone 7 plus has 256gb of storage but i only use half of that and well more than half of what i use is old podcast episodes and unnecessary photos,1,0.9846518282688475,1
614,i think a lot of people can get by with the 64gb model,0,0.9720036921167788,1
615,that said spending an extra 50 on the 128gb model is not a bad idea,1,0.9411877576777508,1
616,storage is something you won’t care much about until you run out but once you do it can be annoying,1,0.9715264969130841,1
617,the 128gb model lets you rack up podcasts photos and apps without constantly deleting old files,1,0.9675244549764683,1
618,i don’t recommend the 256gb model,0,0.8945534144687843,1
619,anyone using that much storage is a serious smartphone enthusiast and the iphone se’s small screen takes it out of consideration for most heavy users,1,0.9922391224249735,1
620,i know there’s a handful of diehard small phone enthusiasts who will want the 256gb model but it’s overkill for most,1,0.9701987945654403,1
621,the iphone se isn’t a 5g phone,0,0.984027665510432,1
622,apple has been slow to embrace 5g and the tech hasn’t filtered down to this price point yet,1,0.9432208453383343,1
623,this makes little difference to me and most buyers because 5g availability is limited,1,0.9510539354473037,1
624,as far as i know i’d have to travel more than 250 miles to get a 5g signal,1,0.9527836966711075,1
625,this is a dualsim device which can be useful for travelers and is a bit surprising given the phone’s price,1,0.9769337548982001,1
626,the iphone se supports bluetooth 50 and the wifi 6 standard,1,0.9736298059686838,1
627,a 1821mah battery powers the iphone se,0,0.9300112621828603,1
628,apple quotes up to 8 hours of battery life while streaming video or 13 hours when playing video from the phone’s local storage,1,0.9893286506319499,1
629,the phone supports fast charging with an 18watt adapter unfortunately not included and supports wireless charging via qi chargers,1,0.948730312061643,1
630,like all iphones the new se sucks down very little juice on standby i suspect it could last a week though i haven’t had it for long enough to test that out,1,0.9903124494274536,1
631,as a pc geek at heart i’m not a heavy smartphone user,1,0.9448967833227815,1
632,my personal iphone tells me i tend have the display on for between one hour and oneandahalf hours each day,1,0.9784941419989949,1
633,its been years since i last tested a phone that can’t last me all day and many can last me two,1,0.9895089198761137,1
634,the iphone se is no exception,1,0.9745954706501951,1
635,i suspect heavy users would have more trouble,1,0.9641088652750096,1
636,a halfhour benchmarking the phone knocked 12 percent off a full charge for example,1,0.9571125709901408,1
637,if you like to play demanding 3d games or you use the phone to watch streaming films you might find it necessary to pick up a midday charge,1,0.9721591104400565,1
638,as i mentioned earlier the iphone se doesn’t target those owners because its small display size isn’t ideal for either gaming or movies,1,0.9824642334494789,1
639,if that’s what you want to do buy a larger phone,1,0.9889991743461003,1
640,but let’s be real android phones can crush the iphone se’s battery life just as the iphone se can crush android’s performance,1,0.9896064050866697,1
641,the moto g power which i recently reviewed has a 5000mah battery,1,0.9688272309399341,1
642,it could last two to three days in my hands,1,0.9891882845473781,1
643,the iphone se certainly can’t match that,1,0.9817044950120211,1
644,for me however battery life isn’t a problem,1,0.9936725711489788,1
645,the iphone se can last all day in my hands and i gain nothing from a phone that lasts longer,1,0.9863331477134389,1
646,the iphone se of course runs ios 13,1,0.9922693530327802,1
647,it’s the phone’s killer feature,0,0.8595699592437711,1
648,i’ve swapped back and forth between ios and android phones ever since i bought my first “real” smartphone the htc thunderbolt in 2011,1,0.9826853517205918,1
649,i’ve always found ios preferable,1,0.9811454653254834,1
650,apple’s ios is quicker more secure and more attractive,1,0.9732073010721523,1
651,i despise the bloatware and barrage of pointless notifications that assail most android phones,1,0.9416025805664184,1
652,yes it’s possible to configure android in a way that mostly fixes the problem but i’d rather not have to,1,0.9735800019215953,1
653,i’m not going to cover every aspect of ios 13 here but there are a few important features you should note,1,0.9880171976946577,1
654,the iphone se of course runs ios 13,1,0.9922693530327802,1
655,it’s the phone’s killer feature,0,0.8595699592437711,1
656,switching from another iphone is an absolute breeze,1,0.9530248726937807,1
657,place the new and old phones beside each other then snap a photo of a pattern shown on the old phone’s screen with the new phone,1,0.984286259943615,1
658,this starts the transfer which can take minutes if you have an icloud backup available,1,0.9322720062787843,1
659,your apps and files make the leap and while you’ll have to log back into some accounts this isn’t true in every instance,1,0.9766985220027837,1
660,i had the iphone se ready to go with all my previous data available in 20 minutes flat,1,0.9665251432021724,1
661,because it lacks face id and has a home button the new se doesn’t use the new touchgesture navigation found on the iphone x and later models,1,0.9959688651823241,1
662,if you own an aging iphone like me you won’t mind,1,0.9778778930310351,1
663,if you own a new model and want to downsize however beware,1,0.9797207776153523,1
664,you’ll have to unlearn everything you learned about navigating new iphone models,1,0.978863480330971,1
665,that could be a frustrating experience,1,0.9755240088181008,1
666,the iphone se also lacks face id,1,0.9941330349137639,1
667,i love facial login when it’s fast and secure as is true on the iphone but it’s pure luxury,1,0.9594513211017482,1
668,touch id is fast fluid and secure,1,0.9778486649013601,1
669,and again the iphone se is targeting people who own older phones,1,0.9886597485363232,1
670,if you’ve never used face id you won’t miss it,1,0.9860636047011815,1
671,apple ships the iphone se with a oneyear limited warranty,0,0.8622488481624934,1
672,that’s the industry standard,1,0.9694814213455352,1
673,you can purchase added protection through applecare which extends the warranty and covers some accidents,0,0.5829541582973085,1
674,applecare is 80 for 24 months of coverage or you can pay monthtomonth for 4,0,0.6991812184888793,1
675,applecare with theft protection is 150 or 8 monthly,1,0.8850805519006668,1
676,i don’t recommend applecare for this phone,0,0.8936420783319317,1
677,this is an inexpensive phone and a small phone that in theory you’re less likely to drop,1,0.9904591858607827,1
678,just slap a case on it and call it good,1,0.97386111440161,1
679,breaking a phone sucks but it’s not likely in this case so you probably won’t have need for applecare service,1,0.9690327723602048,1
680,it’s worth remembering that apple unlike most brands has a large network of physical stores that can provide service,1,0.9579346210930628,1
681,i’ve had better luck solving issues with a visit to an apple store than through the phone support provided by other brands,1,0.9714403689050741,1
682,the iphone se is a good phone and well worth 400,1,0.9944082203103607,1
683,it’s not for everyone but it’s great for many and i’d seriously consider it if i had to buy a new phone right now,1,0.9891905438444598,1
684,is there a better alternative,1,0.9776403294814772,1
685,google’s pixel 3a is the clear competitor,1,0.9796125968076574,1
686,it’s a great android phone at a low price,1,0.9928450238954671,1
687,the iphone se is faster and has a better camera but the pixel 3a has a larger display and you can opt for the pixel 3a xl for a slightly bigger one,1,0.9960107446011419,1
688,right now the pixel 3a xl is just 420 on amazon,1,0.9840570152636823,1
689,i prefer ios so i would buy the iphone se but you might go with the pixel 3a if you’re a fan of android,1,0.993108410502767,1
690,the wild card is google’s pixel 4a which is anticipated but not yet announced,1,0.9509841489397369,1
691,it’ll likely bring camera improvements and an even better display,1,0.9894469267476815,1
692,it will still lag in performance however because nobody’s silicon can outgun apple’s a13 bionic right now,1,0.9815688616450431,1
693,you might also consider the samsung galaxy a51 or the moto g stylus,1,0.9858257606111723,1
694,these midrange android phones throw more features at you some of which are nice to have,1,0.9821478337017119,1
695,the galaxy a51 has a lovely oled display and the moto g stylus has well a stylus,1,0.9833460189825252,1
696,they’re larger phones with big screens that cater to heavy users despite budget pricing,1,0.9836727107654233,1
697,they’re solid phones but the iphone se offers a more cohesive intuitive device with a processor that runs circles around both,1,0.988187137691404,1
698,some shoppers will consider the iphone 11,0,0.934458190090138,1
699,it’s significantly more expensive but has a much larger screen and an ultrawide camera,1,0.9903284295542525,1
700,make no mistake the iphone 11 is a better phone,1,0.9917626981880158,1
701,the 300 gap between the iphone se and the iphone 11 is sizable though and not everyone will find the bigger phone’s advantages worth the bump in price,1,0.9841895561364084,1
702,how long will it last,1,0.9814131828706787,1
703,the iphone se is a fiveyear phone,0,0.9532018173559781,1
704,its performance is excellent and apple unlike most android brands delivers os updates for years after a phone is released,1,0.9739508546602665,1
705,the only issue to note is battery life,1,0.988412780872241,1
706,it’s merely ok and after five years of wear and tear you’ll probably have to deal with midday recharging,1,0.9497983986604273,1
707,should you buy it,0,0.9174907265075873,1
708,yes,0,0.9098462969163978,1
709,the iphone se is a solid entrylevel iphone,1,0.9804053785579765,1
710,you can buy a better device but you don’t need a better device,1,0.9891233393997386,1
711,if you like me consider a smartphone to be just one of many gadgets you could spend money on opting for the 400 se can make a lot of sense,1,0.9895011442598339,1
